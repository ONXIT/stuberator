**Stuberator** is a Laravel package designed to simplify the creation of architectural elements through command generators and stubs. It currently supports the generation of **Actions**, **Services**, and **Enums**. Future releases will include support for **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** modules.

Stuberator provides the following Artisan commands to generate files:

### Generate an Action

The generated file will be placed in the App\Actions namespace by default.

### Generate a Service

```

The generated file will be placed in the App\Enums namespace by default.
